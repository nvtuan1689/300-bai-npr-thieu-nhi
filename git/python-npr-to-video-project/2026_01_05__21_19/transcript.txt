TITLE: Trump wants U.S. oil companies in Venezuela. Here's what to know
======================================================================
LAUREN FRAYER, HOST:This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Lauren Frayer. President Trump has made clear that the U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is, at least in part, about controlling Venezuela's oil. Trump said yesterday at a press conference that U.S. oil companies will spend billions of dollars to support the country's oil infrastructure. NPR's Julia Simon joins us now. And Julia, give us a lay of the land. How big of a deal is Venezuela's oil?JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: Well, Venezuela has one of the biggest oil resources in the world, but their oil output has fallen a lot in recent decades. Venezuela once produced 3 million barrels a day. Now, it's more like 1 million barrels. In the past, much of Venezuela's oil went to refineries in the U.S. Now much of it goes to China. And Lauren, it's important to remember that all oil is bad for global warming. Burning it releases planet-heating carbon dioxide. But Venezuela's oil, experts say, is among the worst for global warming. It requires a lot of energy to extract, and it releases a lot of methane, another powerful pollutant.

FRAYER: And President Trump has said that Venezuela has stolen U.S. oil investment. What is he referring to?

SIMON: Right. U.S. oil companies - they've been drilling in Venezuela for more than a century. But around 2007, then-President Hugo Chavez, he really shook things up. Here's Francisco Monaldi, director of Latin American Energy Program at Rice University.FRANCISCO MONALDI: So Chavez basically forcefully renegotiated contracts. There were three major American companies, and two decided to leave and go in to international arbitration, and the other one decided to stay.

SIMON: So ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips - they left and took the Venezuelan government to international courts, which ordered that Venezuela pay ConocoPhillips over $10 billion and ExxonMobil over 1 billion. Venezuela's only paid a fraction of those sums. Meanwhile, the U.S. company that stayed is Chevron.

FRAYER: Trump has said that U.S. oil companies will come into Venezuela. How likely is that, though?

SIMON: Well, one positive thing for oil companies is that Venezuela - it's pretty well-established. Oil companies have a fairly good idea of what they will find when they drill. Monaldi says for companies owed billions by the Venezuelan government, returning to the country could be an opportunity to recoup some of that money. But look, Lauren, there's lots of reasons oil companies would not want to come back.

FRAYER: Yeah. I mean, imagine some oil companies might feel bruised by their past experiences there.

SIMON: A hundred percent - and the global oil market, it faces an oil oversupply. The price of oil is pretty low. Long-term projections for oil demand are unclear as the world shifts to more electric vehicles. And it's still unclear who is in charge of Venezuela. No one's going to start investing until they're sure that their oil contracts are valid.

FRAYER: Julia, are there even broader regional implications for oil?

SIMON: Yeah. People should also know that next door to Venezuela is Guyana. That's a country which recently discovered massive amounts of oil. It's seen as one of the most attractive places in the world for oil. ExxonMobil is there. For years, Venezuela and Guyana have had a territorial conflict. It relates to oil rights. Last March, Venezuelan vessels entered Guyana's territorial waters. And oil analysts tell NPR that at least right now, without Maduro, Guyana should feel more secure. By the way, ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.

FRAYER: That's NPR's Julia Simon. Julia, thank you.

SIMON: Thank you, Lauren.
