1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
This is all things considered from NPR News. I'm Mary Louise Kelly.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,879
And I'm Scott Dattro. It's New Year's Eve in Mary Louise. I'm curious. Are you making

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,359
any resolutions this year? No. Oh, okay. Are you just just not into it?

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,039
I'm actually totally into it, but my resolution for 2026 is to say no more often. So maybe I got

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,160
ahead of myself there, but no. Scott is a complete sentence. I'm not going to apologize for saying it.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,560
I think that is a really good resolution. I will say I'm going to be I'm sure many people out there

7
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,199
are similar trying to spend less time staring at my phone next year. Good luck. Good luck.

8
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:37,759
Good luck indeed. This is this is all part of a really long tradition. In fact, the New Year's

9
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:43,200
resolution is so old that the practice existed long before there was even a name for it.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,159
In our latest installment of Word of the Week, you know, 2025's last word you might say.

11
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,759
And PR's Rachel Treesman has this brief history. People have been making promises and setting goals

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,439
for the New Year since at least the ancient Romans. They marked the start of January by giving offerings

13
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:05,280
to the month's namesake Janice, the two faced God of beginnings and endings. I think that's the

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,560
origins of our New Year's resolution because a resolution is a kind of promise. That's Alexis

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,239
McCrossen, a history professor at Southern Methodist University. I have been writing about the

16
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:22,719
observances of the New Year for about a decade. And I resolve every year that I will finish my book.

17
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,439
McCrossen explains that Americans were making resolutions for the New Year long before they

18
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,280
recognized it as a holiday. For a long time, January 1st was just a deadline to pay taxes and

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,000
settle debts with neighbors. That's another kind of resolution, more in line with the words

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,079
original meaning of simplifying and solving problems. When you do accounting, you necessarily think

21
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,439
about how to do it better next time. The 19th century saw the growth of Evangelicalism and more

22
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,879
emphasis on the New Year as a time of change. The phrase New Year's resolution started popping up

23
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:02,239
in newspapers as early as 1813. Even so, for the most part, New Year's Eve was a non-event.

24
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:08,000
January 1st was mostly a day for visiting friends or shaking the president's hand at the White House

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,800
until the 20th century. In 1907, the first ball dropped in Times Square and New Year's Eve was

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,240
officially a time for celebration. McCrossen attributes that shift in tone to watch night church

27
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,920
services and German immigrants who imported their tradition of song, dance, and midnight toasts.

28
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,160
I think the resolutions come with the emphasis on midnight, but on the moment of the New Year's

29
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,400
arrival. New Year's resolutions, much like the US itself, have become more secular over time.

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,160
But old newspapers and diaries show that our hopes for the New Year haven't changed all that much.

31
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,400
The most popular resolutions in 1947, according to a Gallup poll, included saving money,

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:03:00,079
being more efficient, and living a better life. That all holds up. Rachel Treesman and PR News.
