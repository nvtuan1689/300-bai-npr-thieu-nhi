HOST: And I'm Scott Detrow. It's New Year's Eve, and, Mary Louise, I'm curious. Are you making any resolutions this year?KELLY: No.DETROW: Oh, OK. Are you just not into it?KELLY: (Laughter) I'm actually totally into it, but my resolution for 2026 is to say no more often, so maybe I got ahead of myself there. But no, Scott, is a complete sentence. I'm not going apologize for saying it.DETROW: I think that is a really good resolution. I will say, I'm going to be - I'm sure many people out there are similar - trying to spend less time staring at my phone next year.KELLY: Good luck. Good luck.DETROW: Good luck, indeed. This is all part of a really long tradition. In fact, the New Year's resolution is so old that the practice existed long before there was even a name for it. In our latest installment of Word of the Week - you know, 2025's the last word, you might say - NPR's Rachel Treisman has this brief history.RACHEL TREISMAN, 

BYLINE:  People have been making promises and setting goals for the new year since at least the ancient Romans. They marked the start of January by giving offerings to the month's namesake, Janus, the two-faced god of beginnings and endings.ALEXIS MCCROSSEN: I think that's the origins of our New Year's resolution because a resolution is a kind of promise.TREISMAN: That's Alexis McCrossen, a history professor at Southern Methodist University.MCCROSSEN: I have been writing about the observances of the New Year for about a decade, and I resolve every year that I will finish my book.TREISMAN: McCrossen explains that Americans were making resolutions for the new year long before they recognized it as a holiday. For a long time, January 1 was just a deadline to pay taxes and settle debts with neighbors. That's another kind of resolution, more in line with the word's original meaning of simplifying and solving problems.MCCROSSEN: When you do accounting, you necessarily think about how to do it better next time.TREISMAN: The 19th century saw the growth of evangelicalism and more emphasis on the new year as a time of change. The phrase New Year's resolution started popping up in newspapers as early as 1813. Even so...MCCROSSEN: For the most part, New Year's Eve was a nonevent.TREISMAN: January 1 was mostly a day for visiting friends or shaking the president's hand at the White House until the 20th century. In 1907, the first ball dropped in Times Square, and New Year's Eve was officially a time for celebration. McCrossen attributes that shift in tone to watch night church services and German immigrants who imported their tradition of song, dance and midnight toasts.MCCROSSEN: I think the resolutions come with the emphasis on midnight, on the moment of the new year's arrival.TREISMAN: New Year's resolutions, much like the U.S. itself, have become more secular over time, but old newspapers and diaries show that our hopes for the new year haven't changed all that much. The most popular resolutions in 1947, according to a Gallup poll, included saving money, being more efficient and living a better life. That all holds up.Rachel Treisman, NPR News.
